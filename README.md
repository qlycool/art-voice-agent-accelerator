# Azure Real-Time (ART) Agent Accelerator

[📖 Documentation](https://aiappsgbbfactory.github.io/art-voice-agent-accelerator/) · [🚀 Quick Start](#getting-started) · [🏗️ Architecture](#the-how-architecture) · [🎨 Community](docs/community/artist-certification.md)

> **TL;DR**: Build real-time, multimodal and omnichannel agents on Azure in minutes, not months. Our approach is code-first, modular, ops-friendly & extensible.

You own the agentic design; this repo handles the end-to-end voice plumbing. We keep a clean separation of concerns—telephony (ACS), app middleware, AI inference loop (STT → LLM → TTS), and orchestration—so you can swap parts without starting from zero. Shipping voice agents is more than "voice-to-voice." You need predictable latency budgets, media handoffs, error paths, channel fan-out, barge-in, noise cancellation, and more. This framework gives you the e2e working spine so you can focus on what differentiates you—your tools, agentic design, and orchestration logic (multi-agent ready).

<summary><b>💡 What you get</b></summary>

### **What you get**

- **Omnichannel, including first-class telephony**. Azure Communication Services (ACS) integration for PSTN, SIP transfer, IVR/DTMF routing, and number provisioning—extendable for contact centers and custom IVR trees.

- **Transport that scales**. FastAPI + WebSockets for true bidirectional streaming; runs locally and scales out in Kubernetes. Leverages ACS bidirectional media streaming for low-latency ingest/playback (barge-in ready), with helper classes to wire your UI WebSocket client or loop back into ACS— the plumbing is done for you.

- **Model freedom**. Use GPT-family or your provider of choice behind a slim adapter; swap models without touching the transport.

- **Clear seams for customization**. Replace code, switch STT/TTS providers, add tool routers, or inject domain policies—without tearing down the whole app.

### **Choose your voice inference pipeline (voice‑to‑voice):**

- **Build from scratch (maximum control).** Use our AI inference layer and patterns to wire STT → LLM → TTS with your preferred Azure services and assessments. Own the event loop, intercept any step, and tailor latency/quality trade-offs for your use case. Ideal for on‑prem/hybrid, strict compliance, or deep customization.

- **Managed path (ship fast, enterprise‑ready).** Leverage the latest addition to the Azure AI family—Azure Voice Live API (preview)—for voice-to-voice media, and connect to Azure AI Foundry Agents for built-in tool/function calling. Keep your hooks; let Azure AI Foundry handle the media layer, scaling, noise suppression, and barge-in.

- **Bring your own voice‑to‑voice model.** Drop in your model behind(e.g., latest gpt‑realtime or equivalent). Transport/orchestration (including ACS telephony) stays the same—no app changes.

*The question of the century: Is it production-ready?*

“Production” means different things, but our intent is clear: this is an accelerator—it gets you ~80% of the way with battle-tested plumbing. You bring the last mile: hardening, infrastructure policies, security posture, SRE/DevOps, and your enterprise release process.

We ship the scaffolding to make that last mile fast: structured logging, metrics/tracing hooks, and a load-testing harness so you can profile end-to-end latency and concurrency, then tune or harden as needed to reach your target volume.

## **The How (Architecture)**

Two orchestration modes—same agent framework, different audio paths:

| Mode | Path | Latency | Best For |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| **SpeechCascade** | Azure Speech STT → LLM → TTS | ~400ms | Custom VAD, phrase lists, Azure voices |
| **VoiceLive** | Azure VoiceLive SDK (gpt-4o-realtime) | ~200ms | Fastest setup, lowest latency |

```bash
# Select mode via environment variable
export ACS_STREAMING_MODE=MEDIA       # SpeechCascade (default)
export ACS_STREAMING_MODE=VOICE_LIVE  # VoiceLive
```

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 SpeechCascade — Full Control</strong></summary>
<br>
<img src="docs/assets/ARTAgentarch.png" alt="SpeechCascade Architecture" />

**You own each step:** STT → LLM → TTS with granular hooks.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Custom VAD** | Control silence detection, barge-in thresholds |
| **Azure Speech Voices** | Full neural TTS catalog, styles, prosody |
| **Phrase Lists** | Boost domain-specific recognition |
| **Sentence Streaming** | Natural pacing with per-sentence TTS |

Best for: On-prem/hybrid, compliance requirements, deep customization.

**Managed voice-to-voice:** Azure-hosted GPT-4o Realtime handles audio in one hop.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **~200ms latency** | Direct audio streaming, no separate STT/TTS |
| **Server-side VAD** | Automatic turn detection, noise reduction |
| **Native tools** | Built-in function calling via Realtime API |
| **Azure Neural Voices** | HD voices like `en-US-Ava:DragonHDLatestNeural` |

Best for: Speed to production, lowest latency requirements.
